# Bromantane

---

### IUPAC
N-(4-bromophenyl)adamantan-2-amine

### Class
Nootropic / Stimulant / Anxiolytic

<!--Analogues: -->
<!--Prodrugs: -->

### Mechanism of Action

Bromantane's mechanism of action primarily involves enhancing dopamine synthesis through upregulation of key enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) via indirect genomic pathways. Bromantane elevates cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), which disinhibits TH (usually blocked by dopamine), leading to increased dopamine synthesis.

Additionally, Bromantane is hypothesized to act as a Kir2.1 channel inhibitor, stabilizing indirect pathway medium spiny neurons (IMSNs) and preventing aberrant synaptogenesis. Moreover, Bromantane reduces inflammatory cytokines and inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC), upregulating neurotrophins like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), contributing to its neuroprotective effects.
